# Final Reflections - Sprint Five 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### Do you feel more or less confident in your JavaScript skills after this sprint? What made you feel this?



### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really good?



### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really bad?



### What did you think Foundations was going to be like before you started?




### What was Foundations actually like?




### How many times during Foundations did you want to give up? What kept you going?




### You're going to be starting bootcamp soon. Do you feel ready? Prepared? Under prepared? How does that make you feel?




### If you received a time traveling text message from your _future_ self, 10 weeks from now, what would it say?




### Do you feel like a programmer? If yes; why? If no; why not?
