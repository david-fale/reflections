# My Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

# Command Line Primer 

using command line to edit files and commit them to github.

commads used

#finding files
find <directory> | grep <name of file/directory>

#moving around directories
cd
-change directory

cd .
-change to current directory

cd..
-move to parent directory

#list directories
ls
-list directories/files

ls -a
-list hidden files/directories

ls -l list more info on directories/files

#remove file/directory
rm -r
-remove recursively

rm -rf remove without a promt to do so

#make a directory
mkdir


### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?

Its like a magic window that creates and edits files/directories.

### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?

no I got carried away, next time I will be more conscious of it.

### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do

ls: list files
rm -rf <filename>: remove file without authentication
cd ..: move to parent directory
find <directory>: search a directory
grep: search for a set of strings (usefull when used with find)

# Install and Explore Git 
   
    #what is github flow

github flow is a branched-based workflow system that intergrates support for teams and projects to work on repositories at the same time.

    #What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?

I noticed that when it came to a particularly confusing question I would take a few minutes to just understand what it is saying by rewinding the video back. If that did not help then I would look for
other material through google.

    #Is there anything you would do differently if you were to repeate the learning exploration again?

Having a good scheduel would be the only thing I would do different, but I have adapted since the first day and make sure that I do not go over the timebox limits.

### Whats the difference between git and GitHub?

git is an open source software that handles sourcecode management with distributed version control, it keeps a record of all actions performed to the code/software in a timeline which shows who edited what.

Github is is a webserver for hosting git repositories which has a GUI and security measures built in to restrict/grant acess where it is needed. It allows useres to store a local repository backup
taking out the risk of only having one central storage server, this also leaves room to work offline if you are unable to get acess to the internet.

### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?

git is like the house and github is like the furnishings.

### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?

I noticed that when it came to a particularly confusing question I would take a few minutes to just understand what it is saying by rewinding the video back. If that did not help then I would look for
other material through google.

### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?

This time it was much better, I kept to the suggested timeboxes and had plenty of time to finish the tasks.

# Branch, Pull, Merge

### What is main?

Main is the most complete and stable timeline in the branches.

### Why create a Branch?

To be able to make a copy and work on the repository without making any changes to the main repository, this allows someone to be able to check your work before adding it to the main branch.

### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?  

Stage is like the presenting area for ideas you might want to implement, it allows you to change and edit the files you want to commit before you actually commit them. Commit is like a save point, once its saved its logged and gives a snapshot of what has been changed.

# GitHub Fork & Clone

### What are some examples of when you would fork?

- When working on open source projects you do not have permission to on the main repository.

- When proposing changes to someone elses code  

### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?

Forking made a lot of sense as it explained to me how open source projects make good progress while protecting the integrity of the main product.

# Setup Repo & Create Blog

### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?

no stage found it pretty intuitive.

### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made; was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?

It looked like what I expected it to be.

# Thinking like a programmer

### What is your process so far for solving problems?

Think about what the question has actually asked. Make a game plan, this makes it much easier to go through the question and stops random small mistakes. Cut the question into smaller pieces if the question is too difficult to answer in one go. Then I try a solution, if it does not work I then I think over it for a few seconds to see where it could have gone wrong. I keep this up till I have answered the question in the chunk I am working on. Once all mini-tasks are completed I bring them back together and see if the solution works, if so I go onto editing the code to modern formatting standards. Otherwise I go back a step and consult mr google for a helpful solution. Once I am done I do the reflection and move on to the next task.
 
# Introduce yourself

### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? 

Weird at first but not that strange.

### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious? 

yea a little bit but once I posted, it passed.
