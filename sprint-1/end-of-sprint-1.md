# Final Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?
The learning strategy I used was to work non-stop taking 20 minute breaks every hour 8:45am-5pm. It worked well as it gave me enough time to re-center my mind before the next workload. I faced problems with timeboxing but I am working on recognising how to split up my time evenly.


### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
Confident as I have had experience using command line before.


### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?
using the command line was the part I enjoyed the most.


### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?
Learning some of the commands took longer than I would have liked but overall it was not too bad.


### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?

No I tend not to hear voices.
