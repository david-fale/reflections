# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  
HTML is sturdy and well built, HTML holds up the website like hercules. HTML does not appeal to everyone HTML is straight to the point. Luckily HTML is never without CSS. CSS makes HTML's blunt way of doing things more appealing.

It is what it is.

### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?
HTML would be a turtle because he holds the website on his back. CSS would be a lion as it likes to stand out.
