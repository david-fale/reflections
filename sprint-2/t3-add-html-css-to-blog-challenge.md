# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  









### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them? 



### Any moments of surprise or joy? 




### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?
