# Foundations Reflections

This repo is where you will complete your reflections questions during foundations.

Currently the five files (one for each sprint) hold a number of questions already. These are to be completed at the end of the sprint in addition to the questions you complete during challenges.

#### Creating your own reflections repo

Follow the instructions during sprint 1 to fork this repo to your own github account. Once there you can clone it down to your own computer and push any changes up to github for your facilitators to see, or edit it directly on your github account.

This has been created as a private repo so will not be viewable to anyone outside of foundations.
