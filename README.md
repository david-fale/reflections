# Foundations Reflections

This repo will be what you use to record your reflections questions during foundations.

During foundations sprints you will be asked to copy and complete questions into these files relating to the primer/challenge you have just completed.

Currently the five files (one for each sprint) hold a number of questions already. These are to be completed at the end of the sprint in addition to the questions you complete during the sprint. 

### Creating your own reflections repo

Follow the instructions during sprint 1 to fork this repo to your own github account. Once there you can clone it down to your own computer and push any changes up to your github for your facilitators to see, or edit it directly on github.

*NB:* This has been created as a private repo so will not be viewable to anyone outside of foundations.
