# My Reflections - Sprint Four 

# Code Readability

### What makes code more readable for you?
Using tabs and proper block level elements. If I don't do that I lose track of my code structure. 
Also a proper naming convention improved my code readability as I actually know what my code is trying to do.


### Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?
tabs as its more convenient.


### What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that?
Messy, my code is generally celaner than my workspace.



# Testing

```
function testSum(){
    var expected = 7
    var actual = sum(5, 2)

    if (actual != expected) {
        console.log("It's broken..")
    } else {
        console.log("It works!")
    }
}
```
### Have a go at writing a "sum" function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`: 
function sum(a, b){
    return a + b;
}


### Do you think you would prefer using Unit Testing or Test Driven Development? Why?
Unit testing as I think it would suit my style of learning.



# Kata

### How did you find using repl.it in practice? Confusing? Useful?
Confusing at first, but after using it for a while I got used to it.

### Was it helpful to look at the tests while coding the kata?
yes somewhat but near the end it didn't help.

### What problem solving techniques did you implement in your coding flow?
Googling and using console.log to see the results.

### What was the most challenging part of Super FizzBuzz for you?
ordering the if else statements to give the correct results.

### Did you want to change and refactor your code once you were finished?
Yes the code I started with was terrible.
