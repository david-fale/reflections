# My Reflections - Sprint Four 

# Code Readability

### What makes code more readable for you?
Using tabs and proper block level elements. If I don't do that I lose track of my code structure. 
Also a proper naming convention improved my code readability as I actually know what my code is trying to do.


### Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?
tabs as its more convenient.


### What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that?
Messy, my code is generally celaner than my workspace.



# Testing

```
function testSum(){
    var expected = 7
    var actual = sum(5, 2)

    if (actual != expected) {
        console.log("It's broken..")
    } else {
        console.log("It works!")
    }
}
```
### Have a go at writing a "sum" function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`: 



### Do you think you would prefer using Unit Testing or Test Driven Development? Why?




# Kata

### How did you find using repl.it in practice? Confusing? Useful?


### Was it helpful to look at the tests while coding the kata?


### What problem solving techniques did you implement in your coding flow?


### What was the most challenging part of Super FizzBuzz for you?


### Did you want to change and refactor your code once you were finished?
