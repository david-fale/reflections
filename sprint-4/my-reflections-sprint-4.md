### Does code readability seem important to you, or unnecessarily fussy? Justify your answer.





# Code Readability Challenge

### As a developer, how important do you think indenting is?



### Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?

# Testing

```
function testSum(){
    var expected = 7
    var actual = sum(5, 2)

    if (actual != expected) {
        console.log("It's broken..")
    } else {
        console.log("It works!")
    }
}
```
Have a go at writing a function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`:
