# My Reflections - Sprint Four 

# Code Readability Primer

### What makes code more readable for you?




# Code Readability Challenge

### Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?



### What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that?




# Testing

```
function testSum(){
    var expected = 7
    var actual = sum(5, 2)

    if (actual != expected) {
        console.log("It's broken..")
    } else {
        console.log("It works!")
    }
}
```
### Have a go at writing a "sum" function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`: 



### Do you think you would prefer using Unit Testing or Test Driven Development? Why?



### Was your initial response to the idea of testing, "That sounds useful" or "That sounds like a hassle"? Why?





# Repl.it - Code in your browser

### How did you find using repl.it in practice? Confusing? Useful?



### When you say the name of the website in your head, how are you pronouncing it? "REPLIT"? "REP-ILL-IT"? "REPELL-IT"?




# Problem Solving and Pseudocode 

### Pick two problem solving techniques you would like to put into practice. Which ones have you chosen?



### How will you implement these techniques into your day to day coding flow? How will you make sure that you actually do them?






# JavaScript Variables and Object Types

### Did you look at the tests while coding the kata? Was it helpful?




# Manipulating JavaScript Objects

### Did you find you preferred following the steps given to you or using the test outputs in your repl? Why?





# FizzBuzz (Super Edition)

### What was the most challenging part of Super FizzBuzz for you?



### How did you find using pseudocode during this kata?





# JavaScript Gradebook

### Did you go back and rewrite code as you got to new steps? Is there anything you would change about your final code?





# Built-in Methods

### What resources did you use to help you? How useful did you find them?
