# Final Reflections - Sprint Four 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?



### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel smart?



### Which parts of this sprint made you un-smart?



### Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this sprint? How often? Did you stretch your body?



### If you went back and did the JavaScript Basics course again from last sprint, how challenging do you think you would find it now?



### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this sprint, what would it say? 



### What is Javascript?
